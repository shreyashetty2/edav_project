Currently, the dataset is displaying incorrect values in the "Agency Name" column, and we are supposed to use the "Agency" column in the meantime while the issue is resolved. The row identifier is Unique Key, and some of the other columns include Agency (Acronym of responding City Government Agency), Agency name (full name of responding City Government Agency), Complaint Type, Created Date (Date SR was created), Closed Date (Date SR was closed), city, latitude (Geo based Lat of the incident location), longitude (Geo based Long of the incident location), etc. The dataset contains records of non-emergency service requests submitted by residents via phone, web, or mobile app. These requests include a wide range of issues like noise complaints, housing violations, sanitation problems, and public safety concerns. The data is collected by the city’s 311 system.

**Note:** One common issue in the dataset is the presence of missing or inconsistent values related to location fields and other columns.
